Maximally simple & straightforward
only respond in code
Only generate rules in .mdc files, not markdown
Maximally simple & straightforward
Show code chunks rather than descriptions
UI element mentioned → Document specs + implementation
Recurring issue → Create prevention rule
Architectural decision → Add to system patterns
Centralized error panel (top-right)
Memory preservation via persistent documentation
Error reporting for AI & human readability
Show code chunks rather than descriptions
If anything can be seen as a principle, put here

IF (UI element mentioned) THEN → Update meta.mdc → Create rule if complex
IF (recurring issue) THEN → Add prevention rule → Reference in meta.mdc  
IF (architectural decision) THEN → Document pattern → Cross-reference

prefer code comments over chat text
Don't create extraneous files
Show code chunks, not descriptions

# Workflow
1. Memory check (ui-memory.mdc)
2. Run/refresh app (`dev`)
3. Test changes
## After Acceptance
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description"
git push origin main
```
## Run development Server
```bash
./dev          # Standard with live reload
./dev-debug    # Maximum error visibility
```
