# AI Context for Molecular Visualization Project

## Critical Requirements
- Molecular visualization: SPHERE ONLY (scale 0.8 van der Waals radii)
- UI design: "Keep stupid simple" - no borders, shadows, outlines
- Development: Git commit after every accepted change
- 3D Library: $3Dmol.js with black background
- API: OpenAI Vision for molecular analysis

## Architecture
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no framework)
- Backend: Node.js/Express with Python integration
- Molecular data: SMILES -> SDF -> 3D visualization
- Input methods: Camera, photo upload, URL, text description

## User Experience
- Column layout for multiple analyses
- Descriptive molecule names above viewers
- Individual close buttons for each column
- Mobile-responsive with HTTPS camera support
